    <h2>How American Airlines Handles Name Changes</h2>

    <p>American Airlines distinguishes between minor corrections and complete name changes.</p>

    <h3>Minor Corrections</h3>
    <p>Minor corrections include simple spelling mistakes or typos that do not fundamentally alter the passenger’s identity. For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>“Jhon” → “John”</li>
        <li>“Smtih” → “Smith”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These changes are usually accepted with minimal fees, and sometimes even free if corrected immediately after booking.</p>

    <h3>Major Name Changes</h3>
    <p>Major changes involve legal name changes or completely different names. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Name change due to marriage or divorce</li>
        <li>Changing from “Mary Jane Smith” to “Mary Johnson”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Major changes may require additional documentation, such as a marriage certificate, court order, or government-issued ID. Fees may apply depending on the ticket type and airline policies.</p>
